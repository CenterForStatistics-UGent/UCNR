## Introduction

This folder contains scripts and data files underlying the manuscript "A Unified Censored Normal Regression Model for qPCR Differential Gene Expression Analysis".

(add reference and link to manuscript once published)

## Contents

This folder contains three subfolders:
1. Reproduce: this folder contains R scripts and data files needed to reproduce the simulations as carried out to demonstrate the properties of the Unified Censored Normal Regression (UCNR) model as compared to other methods for dealing with censored observations.
2. CaseStudy1: this folder contains R scripts and data files needed to analyse the first case study in the manuscript. It gives an example of how to use the UCNR model with modified global mean normalization (model 2 in the manuscript). The code can be easily adapted to analyze the users' own data.
3. CaseStudy2: this folder contains R scripts and data files needed to analyse the second case study in the manuscript.
	+ It gives an example of how to use the UCNR model with reference gene normalization (model 3 in the manuscript). The code can be easily adapted to analyze the users' own data.
	+ Additionally, it demonstrates how to calculate results using the MNV+1 and LOD imputation techniques, and how these results compare.
